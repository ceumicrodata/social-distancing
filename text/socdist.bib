  abstract = "What impact will terrorism have on America's cities?
              Historically, large-scale violence has impacted cities in three
              ways: First, concentrations of people have an advantage in
              defending themselves from attackers, making cities more appealing
              in times of violence. Second, cities often make attractive
              targets for violence, which creates an incentive for people to
              disperse. Third, since warfare and terrorism often specifically
              target means of transportation, violence can increase the
              effective cost of transportation, which will usually increase the
              demand for density. Evidence on war and cities in the 20th
              century suggests that the effect of wars on urban form can be
              large (for example, Berlin in World War II), but more commonly
              neither terrorism nor wars have significantly altered urban form.
              As such, across America the effect of terrorism on cities is
              likely to be small. The only exception to this is downtown New
              York which, absent large-scale subsidies, will probably not be
              fully rebuilt. Furthermore, such subsidies make little sense to

               looking at both urbanization and urban concentration, asking
               whether and when there is under or over-urbanization or under or
               over urban concentration. Writers argue that national government
               policies and non-democratic institutions promote excessive
               concentration--the extent to which the urban population of a
               country is concentrated in one or two major metropolitan
               areas--except in former planned economies where migration
               restrictions are enforced. These literatures assume that there
               is an optimal level of urbanization or an optimal level of urban
               concentration, but no research to date has quantitatively
               examined the assumption and asked the basic ``so-what''
               question--how great are the economic losses from significant
               deviations from any optimal degrees of urban concentration or
               rates of urbanization? This paper shows that (1) there is a best
               degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing
               productivity growth (2) that best degree varies with the level
               of development and country size, and (3) over or
               under-concentration can be very costly in terms of productivity
               growth. The paper shows also that productivity growth is not
               strongly affected by urbanization per se. Rapid urbanization has
               often occurred in the face of low or negative economic growth
               over some decades. Moreover, urbanization is a transitory
               phenomenon where many countries are now fully urbanized.]",

  abstract  = "CONTEXT: A critical question in pandemic influenza planning is
               the role nonpharmaceutical interventions might play in delaying
               the temporal effects of a pandemic, reducing the overall and
               peak attack rate, and reducing the number of cumulative deaths.
               Such measures could potentially provide valuable time for
               pandemic-strain vaccine and antiviral medication production and
               distribution. Optimally, appropriate implementation of
               nonpharmaceutical interventions would decrease the burden on
               health care services and critical infrastructure. OBJECTIVES: To
               examine the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions
               for epidemic mitigation in 43 cities in the continental United
               States from September 8, 1918, through February 22, 1919, and to
               determine whether city-to-city variation in mortality was
               associated with the timing, duration, and combination of
               nonpharmaceutical interventions; altered population
               susceptibility associated with prior pandemic waves; age and sex
               distribution; and population size and density. DESIGN AND
               SETTING: Historical archival research, and statistical and
               epidemiological analyses. Nonpharmaceutical interventions were
               grouped into 3 major categories: school closure; cancellation of
               public gatherings; and isolation and quarantine. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES: Weekly excess death rate (EDR); time from the
               activation of nonpharmaceutical interventions to the first peak
               EDR; the first peak weekly EDR; and cumulative EDR during the
               entire 24-week study period. RESULTS: There were 115,340 excess
               pneumonia and influenza deaths (EDR, 500/100,000 population) in
               the 43 cities during the 24 weeks analyzed. Every city adopted
               at least 1 of the 3 major categories of nonpharmaceutical
               interventions. School closure and public gathering bans
               activated concurrently represented the most common combination
               implemented in 34 cities (79\%); this combination had a median
               duration of 4 weeks (range, 1-10 weeks) and was significantly
               associated with reductions in weekly EDR. The cities that
               implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions earlier had greater
               delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r = -0.74, P <
               .001), lower peak mortality rates (Spearman r = 0.31, P = .02),
               and lower total mortality (Spearman r = 0.37, P = .008). There
               was a statistically significant association between increased
               duration of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a reduced total
               mortality burden (Spearman r = -0.39, P = .005). CONCLUSIONS:
               These findings demonstrate a strong association between early,
               sustained, and layered application of nonpharmaceutical
               interventions and mitigating the consequences of the 1918-1919
               influenza pandemic in the United States. In planning for future
               severe influenza pandemics, nonpharmaceutical interventions

               developing effective vaccines and medications for prophylaxis

              infectious contacts between persons form an integral part of
              plans to mitigate the impact of the next influenza pandemic.
              Although the potential benefits of NPIs are supported by
              mathematical models, the historical evidence for the impact of
              such interventions in past pandemics has not been systematically
              examined. We obtained data on the timing of 19 classes of NPI in
              17 U.S. cities during the 1918 pandemic and tested the hypothesis
              that early implementation of multiple interventions was
              associated with reduced disease transmission. Consistent with
              this hypothesis, cities in which multiple interventions were
              implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death
              rates approximately 50\% lower than those that did not and had
              less-steep epidemic curves. Cities in which multiple
              interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic
              also showed a trend toward lower cumulative excess mortality, but
              the difference was smaller (approximately 20\%) and less
              statistically significant than that for peak death rates. This
              finding was not unexpected, given that few cities maintained NPIs
              longer than 6 weeks in 1918. Early implementation of certain
              interventions, including closure of schools, churches, and
              theaters, was associated with lower peak death rates, but no
              single intervention showed an association with improved aggregate
              outcomes for the 1918 phase of the pandemic. These findings
              support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs
              can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral
              spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.",

                 productivity, wages and land prices when the aggregate stock

                 aggregate productivity over and above the direct effect of
                 human capital on individual productivity. Furthermore,
                 increases in education can reduce criminal participation and
                 improve voters' political behavior. In this paper, I review

              survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote

               production as it hinders knowledge transmission. This paper
               provides evidence to suggest that a way in which multinational
               firms economize on costly information transfers is by using
               skilled foreign workers, since local talent can substitute for
               knowledge inputs from the headquarters. Combining U.S. data on
               headquarter service exports with information on communication
               costs and skill endowments by country, I find that while
               communication costs decrease the export of headquarter services
               to foreign affiliates, the effect becomes weaker in the average
               educational attainment of foreign workers. The sensitivity of
               headquarter service exports to communication barriers at low

               control relies on the information of the principal, which we
               equate with publicly available information. Decentralized
               control, on the other hand, delegates authority to a manager
               with superior information. However, the manager can use his
               informational advantage to make choices that are not in the best
               interest of the principal. As the available public information
               about the specific technology increases, the tradeoff shifts in
               favor of centralization. We show that firms closer to the
               technological frontier, firms in more heterogeneous
               environments, and younger firms are more likely to choose
               decentralization. Using three data sets on French and British

               explain why some business units are able to benefit from
               knowledge residing in other parts of the company while others
               are not. The core premise of this concept is that a proper
               understanding of effective interunit knowledge sharing in a
               multiunit firm requires a joint consideration of relatedness in
               knowledge content among business units and the network of
               lateral interunit relations that enables task units to access
               related knowledge. Results from a study of 120 new product
               development projects in 41 business units of a large multiunit
               electronics company showed that project teams obtained more
               existing knowledge from other units and completed their projects
               faster to the extent that they had short interunit network paths
               to units that possessed related knowledge. In contrast, neither
               network connections nor extent of related knowledge alone
               explained the amount of knowledge obtained and project
               completion time. The results also showed a contingent effect of
               having direct interunit relations in knowledge networks: While
               established direct relations mitigated problems of transferring
               noncodified knowledge, they were harmful when the knowledge to
               be transferred was codified, because they were less needed but
               still involved maintenance costs. These findings suggest that
               research on knowledge transfers and synergies in multiunit firms
               should pursue new perspectives that combine the concepts of
               network connections and relatedness in knowledge content.",

  abstract  = "A large literature has shown that geographic frictions reduce
               trade, but has not clarified precisely why. In this paper, we
               provide some insight into why such frictions matter by examining
               what parts of trade these frictions reduce most. Using data that
               track manufacturers' shipments within the US on an exceptionally
               fine grid, we find that the pattern of shipments is extremely
               localized. Shipments within 5-digit zip codes, which have a
               median radius of just 4 miles, are 3 times larger than shipments
               outside the zip code. We decompose aggregate shipments into
               extensive and intensive margins, and show that distance and
               other frictions reduce aggregate trade values primarily by
               reducing the number of commodities shipped and the number of
               establishments shipping. Extensive margins are particularly
               important over very short distances. We examine trade in
               intermediate goods as an explanation for highly localized
               shipments and the dominant role of the extensive margin and find
               evidence consistent with this hypothesis. In another significant
               finding, we find no evidence of state-level home bias when
