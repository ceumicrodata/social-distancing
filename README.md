# Replication instructions
### Software
Analysis uses [Stata 15.1](https://www.stata.com/stata15/) without any additional Stata packages.

The entry point for analysis is `analysis/Makefile`, which can be run by [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) on any Unix-like system by 
```
cd analysis
make
```

The dependence of outputs on code and input data is captured in the respective Makefiles.

We have used Mac OS X, but all the code should run on Linux and Windows platforms, too.
### Hardware
The analysis takes a few minutes on a standard laptop.

### File organization
1. Raw data are in `data/raw/<vendor>/<dataset>`. This data is saved as it has been received from the data publisher, downloaded by the respective Makefiles. Each folder has a `README.md` with data citation and license terms.
2. Clean data are in `data/clean/<dataset>`. Each folder has a `Makefile` that specifies the steps of data cleaning.
3. Analysis data are in `data/derived/<topic>`. Each folder has a `Makefile` that specifies the steps of sample specification, variable selection and modification.
4. Analysis codes are in `analysis/`. A `Makefile` specifies how the .do files have to be run to reproduce the analysis.
